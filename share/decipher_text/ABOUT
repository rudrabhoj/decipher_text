III.   Efficient handling of memory. [Partially done]
IV.    Recognition support for the multi-lingual text. [X]
V.     Multi-core recognition. [X]
VI.    Recognize all pages with one button. [X]
VII.  Copy single page or entire project text with removal of extra line breaks [ ]
VIII. Built-in image manipulation support to make OCR process simpler [ ]
IX.    Importing multipage PDF files. [ ]

While lot of work had been done in the current version: VERSION_NO, we have lot more to do. The overall goal is also to keep the code good-looking and smooth. Major refactoring shall be done when we move from beta to stable version.
