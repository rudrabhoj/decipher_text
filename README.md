# decipher_text
In my free time I read old books. I hate the fact I can not copy paste. And I am unable to chooose, what I hate more, nuclear weapons or reading from the raw scan. While I can not destroy the nukes, here we are with a modern GUI front-end for the TesseractOCR. While there exist quite a few GUI frontends for the TesseractOCR, none of them feel enough. Proof-reading in most of them is as far away from optimum as two poles of the magnet. Most of them feel second class citizen compared to the Commercial OCR programs. I do not use Windows for anything other than gaming, and even if I did, I often work with multi-lingual texts containing both Latin and Devangari Script which no major commercial OCR software supports.
